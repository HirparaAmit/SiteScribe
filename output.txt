Chips summary
Three giant leaps.
MacBook Pro blasts forward with the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. Built on 3‑nanometre technology and featuring an all-new GPU architecture, they’re the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer. And each one brings more pro performance and capability.




















															8-core CPU
														



															10-core GPU
														



															Up to 24GB unified memory
														

















															Up to 12-core CPU
														



															Up to 18-core GPU
														



															Up to 36GB unified memory
														

















															Up to 16-core CPU
														



															Up to 40-core GPU
														



															Up to 128GB unified memory
														


















GPU
Game-changing graphics performance.

























































































										Behold an entirely new class of GPU architecture. And the biggest breakthrough in graphics yet for Apple silicon. Dynamic Caching optimises fast on-chip memory to dramatically increase average GPU utilisation — driving a huge performance boost for the most demanding pro apps and games.
									



Games will look more detailed than ever  thanks to hardware-accelerated mesh shading. This brings greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, enabling games to render more visually complex scenes.
									






											Up to 2.5x faster rendering than 16″ MacBook Pro with M1 Max3










CPU
Hardware-accelerated ray tracing.
For the first time, MacBook Pro features hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Combined with the new graphics architecture, it enables pro apps to deliver up to two-and-a-half-times faster rendering performance and allows games to provide more realistic shadows and reflections.






















































Maxon Cinema 4D












												Up to 80% faster CPU multithreaded performance than 16″ MacBook Pro with M1 Max4

Next-generation CPU cores drive a super-responsive experience while maintaining incredible power efficiency.





												Over 18 trillion operations per second
											
An enhanced 16-core Neural Engine accelerates popular machine learning models. Image processing tools like DeNoise AI and Gigapixel AI from Topaz get even faster.

The best display ever in a laptop.













Extreme Dynamic Range lets you maintain extreme brightness for HDR content, delivering outstanding contrast between the brightest brights and the blackest blacks. And now SDR content is displayed up to 20% brighter.












ProMotion makes everything from scrolling to gaming superfluid and responsive, automatically adjusting to match the movement of content — with refresh rates up to 120Hz. Video editors can also choose a fixed refresh rate that precisely aligns with their footage.
